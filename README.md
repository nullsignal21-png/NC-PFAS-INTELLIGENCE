# NC-PFAS-INTELLIGENCE
end-to-end data pipeline and interactive dashboard for PFAS contamination in North Carolina. Ingests EPA and state datasets, cleans and standardizes PFAS measurements, assesses health risk by county and ZIP code, interpolates missing data, and visualizes results with maps and a Streamlit app.
 Environmental & Public Health Impact
Why This Project Matters

PFAS (“forever chemicals”) persist in the environment for decades, contaminate drinking water, bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife, and are linked to cancer, immune suppression, developmental harm, and endocrine disruption. Despite this, PFAS data is fragmented, technical, and inaccessible to the public.

This project transforms raw regulatory data into actionable environmental intelligence.

 Environmental Impact
1. Increased Environmental Awareness

By aggregating and visualizing PFAS contamination across North Carolina, the platform makes invisible chemical pollution visible. Counties and ZIP codes with elevated risk are clearly identified, helping communities understand their local environmental exposure.

2. Data-Driven Accountability

The system integrates EPA UCMR 5 data and state-level sampling to highlight contamination patterns. This transparency encourages:

Stronger regulatory enforcement

Public pressure for cleanup and remediation

Improved monitoring of industrial polluters

3. Reduction of Long-Term Environmental Damage

Early identification of high-risk areas supports faster intervention, reducing PFAS spread into groundwater, rivers, and ecosystems. Preventing further contamination lowers long-term ecological damage and cleanup costs.

4. Sustainable, Low-Overhead Technology

The platform is entirely data-driven and cloud-light:

No physical infrastructure

Minimal compute overhead

Open-source tooling
This ensures environmental monitoring without additional environmental burden.

 Human & Community Benefits
1. Public Health Protection

Residents can instantly assess PFAS risk by ZIP code, removing the need to interpret dense regulatory reports. This empowers people to:

Avoid unsafe drinking water

Install appropriate filtration systems

Protect vulnerable populations (infants, pregnant individuals, immunocompromised people)

2. Equity & Environmental Justice

PFAS contamination often disproportionately affects rural, low-income, and industrial-adjacent communities. By mapping risk at the ZIP level and interpolating missing data, the platform ensures no community is ignored due to lack of testing.

3. Actionable Guidance, Not Just Data

Each risk level is paired with clear health guidance:

What the risk means

What actions to take immediately

When to seek testing or alternative water sources

This bridges the gap between science and real-world decision-making.

4. Support for Policymakers & Researchers

Cleaned datasets (CSV + JSON) and geospatial outputs can be reused by:

Environmental researchers

Journalists

Local governments

Advocacy organizations

This accelerates research, reporting, and policy response.

Technical Impact with Real-World Consequences

Converts unstructured PDFs and raw EPA files into standardized datasets

Normalizes PFAS measurements across years and sources

Applies EPA MCL thresholds for risk classification

Interpolates missing geographic data responsibly

Delivers insights through interactive maps and a live dashboard

The result: regulatory-grade analysis presented in a human-readable form.

 Bottom Line

This project lowers the barrier between environmental data and human action. By turning complex PFAS contamination records into clear, localized risk intelligence, it helps protect public health, promotes environmental justice, and supports a cleaner, more informed future.
